Description: Reads chromatograms from binary formats into R objects. Currently supports conversion of 'Agilent ChemStation', 'Agilent MassHunter', and 'ThermoRaw' files as well as various text-based formats. Utilizes file parsers from external libraries, such as 'Aston' <https://github.com/bovee/aston>, 'Entab' <https://github.com/bovee/entab>, 'rainbow' <https://rainbow-api.readthedocs.io/>, and 'ThermoRawFileParser' <https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser>.
