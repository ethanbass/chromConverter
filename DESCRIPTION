Description: Reads chromatograms from binary formats into R objects. Currently supports 
    conversion of 'Agilent ChemStation', 'Agilent MassHunter', 'Shimadzu LabSolutions', 
    'ThermoRaw', and 'Varian Workstation' files as well as various text-based formats. 
    In addition to its internal parsers, chromConverter contains bindings to parsers in
    external libraries, such as 'Aston' <https://github.com/bovee/aston>, 
    'Entab' <https://github.com/bovee/entab>, 'rainbow' <https://rainbow-api.readthedocs.io/>,
    and 'ThermoRawFileParser' <https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser>.
