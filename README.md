### Installation

chromConverter can now be installed directly from CRAN:

```
install.packages("chromConverter")
```

However, it's recommended to install the development version of chromConverter from GitHub as follows:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/ethanbass/chromConverter/")
```

or from [R Universe](https://r-universe.dev/):

```
install.packages("chromConverter", repos="https://ethanbass.r-universe.dev/", type="source")
```

### Usage

##### Importing chromatograms

The workhorse of chromConverter is the `read_chroms` function, which functions as a wrapper around all of the supported parsers. To convert files, call `read_chroms`, specifying the `paths` to a vector of directories or files and the appropriate file format (`format_in`). Supported formats include `chemstation_uv`, `chemstation_csv`, `masshunter_dad`, `shimadzu_fid`, `shimadzu_dad`, `chromeleon_uv`, `thermoraw`, `mzml`, `waters_arw`, `msd`, `csd`, and `wsd`.

```
library(chromConverter)
dat <- read_chroms(path, format_in = "chemstation_uv")
```

The `read_chroms` function will attempt to determine an appropriate parser to use and whether you've provided a vector of directories or files. However, if you'd like to be more explicit, you can provide arguments to the `parsers` and `find_files` arguments. Setting `find_files = FALSE` will instruct the function that you are providing a vector of files, while `find_files = TRUE` implies that you are providing a vector of directories.

###### Exporting files

If you'd like to automatically export the files, include the desired file format (`export_format`) and the path where you'd like to export the files (`path_out`). Some parsers (e.g. `OpenChrom` and `ThermoRawFileParser`) need to export files for their basic operations. Thus, if these parsers are selected, you will need to specify an argument to `path_out`.

```
library(chromConverter)
dat <- read_chroms(path, find_files = FALSE, path_out="temp", export=TRUE)
```

###### Choosing between multiple parsers

For formats where multiple parsers are available, you can choose between them using the `parser` argument. For example, 'Agilent' files can now be read using parsers from a number of external libraries, including Aston, Entab, OpenChrom, and rainbow. Some of these parsers must be installed manually as described in the [installation instructions](README.md#Installation) further up the page. It is recommended to use the newer Entab or rainbow parsers, since Aston is no longer actively supported. 

###### OpenChrom parsers

Parsers in OpenChrom are organized by detector-type. Thus, for the `format_in` argument, the user must specify whether the files come from a mass selective detector (`msd`), a current-selective detector like a flame-ionization detector (`csd`), or a wavelength-selective detector (`wsd`), rather than providing a specific file format. In addition, the user should specify what format they'd like to export (`export_format`). Current options include `csv`, `cdf`, `mzml`, or `animl` (the analytical information markup language). The files will then be converted by calling OpenChrom through the command-line interface. If the files are exported in `csv` or `mzml` format, the chromatograms will be automatically read into R. Otherwise, files will be exported to the specified folder but will not be read into the R workspace.

###### Extracting metadata

chromConverter includes some options to extract metadata from the provided files. If `read_metadata = TRUE`, metadata will be extracted and stored as [attributes](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/attributes.html) of the associated object. The metadata can then be accessed using the `attributes` or `attr` functions on individual chromatograms, or extracted into a data.frame or tibble from a list of chromatograms using the `extract_metadata` function. 

##### Importing peak lists

The `read_peaklist` function can be used to import peak lists from 'Agilent ChemStation' REPORT files or 'Shimadzu' ascii files. The syntax is similar to `read_chroms`. In the simplest case, you can just provide paths to the files or directory you want to read in along with the format (`format_in`), e.g.

```
pks <- read_peaklist(<path_to_directory>, format_in = "chemstation")
```

#### Optional additional dependencies

Some of the parsers rely on external software libraries that must be manually installed.

##### **Aston**

To install Aston, call the `configure_aston()` function to install miniconda along with the necessary python dependencies. Running `read_chroms` with the Aston parser selected should also trigger a prompt to install Aston. If you're running Windows, you may need to install the latest version of ['Microsoft Visual C++'](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) if you don't already have it.

##### **Entab**

[Entab](https://github.com/bovee/entab) is a Rust-based parsing framework for converting a variety of scientific file formats into tabular data. To use parsers from Entab, you must first install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Entab-R. After following the [instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install Rust, you can install Entab from GitHub as follows:

```
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/bovee/entab/", subdir = "entab-r")
```

##### **ThermoRawFileParser**

Thermo RAW files can be converted by calling the [ThermoRawFileParser](https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser) on the command-line. To install the ThermoRawFileParser, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/compomics/ThermoRawFileParser). If you are running Linux or Mac OS X, you will also need to install [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin), following the instructions provided at the link. In addition, when you use chromConverter to convert Thermo RAW files for the first time you will be asked to enter the path to the program.

##### **OpenChrom** 
###### (**Note:** Support for the commmand line interface has been removed from OpenChrom (as of `version 1.5.0`). Older versions (e.g. `1.4.x`) should still work for now. Unfortunately, OpenChrom 1.4 has been scrubbed from the internet.

[OpenChrom](https://lablicate.com/platform/openchrom) is a free chromatography software, containing a large number of file parsers, which can now be conveniently accessed directly from R. Strangely, configuring OpenChrom for use on the command-line deactivates the graphical user interface (GUI). Thus, it is recommended to make a separate copy of OpenChrom if you'd still like to access the GUI. To use the OpenChrom parsers, follow the steps detailed below: 

1) [OpenChrom](https://lablicate.com/platform/openchrom/download) **version â¤ 1.4** is unfortunately no longer available from Lablicate. If you already have version 1.4 and like using the commandline interface make sure you have it backed up!!
2) If you intend to use the GUI in the future, it is recommended to make a separate copy of OpenChrom for command-line use.
3) Call `read_chroms` with `parser = "openchrom"`. The first time you call the parser, you may be asked to provide the path to your local installation of OpenChrom. The path will then be saved for future use. If the command-line interface is disabled, you will be given the option to automatically activate the command-line.  Alternatively, the command-line option can be activated from R by calling `configure_openchrom(cli = "true")` or following the [instructions](https://github.com/OpenChrom/openchrom/wiki/CLI) to manually activate the CLI. This process can be reversed using the same function: e.g. `configure_openchrom(cli = "false"). To specify an OpenChrom executable in a non-standard location, call `configure_openchrom` with the `path` argument, e.g. `configure_openchrom(cli = "true", path = "path_to_openchrom_executable").

### Further analysis
